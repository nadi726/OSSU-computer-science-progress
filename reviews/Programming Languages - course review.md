Due to a combination of unfortunate circumstances, this course, especially part C, took me waaay longer than it should have - around 10 months(!!!). Therefore, at the point of writing this review, I'm probably missing some stuff and misremembering other stuff. Regardless, this was an influential course for me.

*Programming Languages* has a slightly misleading name. Its not about studying a bunch of programming languages or anything of the sort. Its about studying the core **concepts** behind programming languages - concepts that have stood the test of time. And not just studying each concepts in isolation: its about seeing how those concepts relate to each other, either by combining them, or by contrasting them, looking at the pros and cons of each one and when using one over the other might be preferable.

The course is divided into three parts out of convenience, with each part focusing on certain often-related concepts. In each part we study one language(SML, Racket and Ruby - in this order), but the study of the language is really more of a lens to looking at the concepts and design that languages have in general, so the language used is less important.

The course covers a wide range of concepts. The main topics are Functional Programming, Object-Oriented programming, Static Typing and Dynamic typing, but it goes into a lot of details in each and covers much more than that. The most rewarding parts of the course for me are those that contrast and compare different concepts learned throughout the course. For example, a really fascinating break-down of how Functional and Object-oriented programming decompose programs, and when you might prefer to use one over the other.

One key takeaway from the course is something that I noticed when I was halfway through. At the same time, I was learning a language for other purposes - Dart, a statically typed, Object-Oriented language - and I was pleasantly surprised by how easily I managed to learn the language in a short time-span, and at the same time reach a relatively deep understanding of it. It was especially surprising because I've never learned a language similar to dart in the past (like Java).
The point here is that the course really did help me understand programming languages on a deeper level by teaching me core concepts and - just as importantly - giving me the **tools** to analyze programming languages.

A couple of other things: The instructor Dan Grossman is awesome, and his passion for the material is very hard to miss. His explanations are great, and there are also summaries of the material which I've found very helpful. The homework assignments are great and help solidify the materials, although I've found the peer assignments not as helpful. There is also additional practice material for most weeks of the course, and they seem helpful, but I didn't really need most of it. The tests are somewhat confusing but pretty easy if you know the material well.
