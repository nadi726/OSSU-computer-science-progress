My personal progress of the OSSU computer science curriculum.
following version 8.0.0

# Background
Self taught, been programming on-and-off for several years with large gaps in between.
I took python for everybody many years ago, then thorughout the years came back to python several times, doing small-scale projects and reading various resources and books, then took CS50 around a year and a half before starting OSSU.
At the time of starting OSSU, I have experience with python, scheme(did chapter 1 of SICP), and a bit of C and Go.
I did some small projects in python (around 600 lines max), and made minor contributions to some open source projects.
